        <li>In an article by Independent the InfoWars host Alex Jones states that Michelle Obama always hides a rather large bulge in her dress</li>
        <li> Many have also claimed that she has a very masculine face and very broad shoulders</li>
        <li>Another shocking fact is that on many occasions Obama has refereed to the First "Lady" as Michael</li>
        <li>Even the doctor of Michelle, Dr. Rafael Espinanzo has said that â€œMichelle Obama is not a woman who used to be a man. Michelle Obama is just a man with breast implants and a huge shaving bill. On the campaign trail, no medical staff was allowed to go near her other than to take vitals if she got sick, which she never did."</li>
